# dotnet-core-3-wpf
A simple wpf application to demonstrate its functionality in .NET Core 3.0. 


# Kata requirements

For this kata there are two specific requirements: **latest preview .NET Core 3.0** and **latest preview VS 2019**. It would be worth installing this before you attend the meetup - it takes around **40 mins**. 

## Prereqs

### .NET Core 3.0 (latest preview)

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0

Tuesday Sept 17th - For Windows you should have: `dotnet-sdk-3.0.100-rc1-014190-win-x64`
To test:
dotnet --version

### VS 2019 (latest preview)

		https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/
		Community - unless you have a personal Visual Studio Professional or Enterprise license
		
Upgraded from 16.2.0 Preview 2.0
		- Tuesday Sept 17th
		- `16.3.0 Preview 4.0`

### Or for VS Code:
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-preview-3/

`A new preview C# extension update is available for VS Code that includes the latest C# compiler (aligned with .NET Core Preview 3 and Visual Studio 2019 Preview 4), which is required to use new C# 8.0 syntax. You need to download the extension and then install it as a VSIX in VS Code (VSIX install is in Extensions settings).

# Kata steps

## Master branch

The initial master branch simply is a blank WPF application, with a single `Hello World`button that does nothing.

## Other brances

The other branches that have the naming convention of <stage_number>_<description_of_stage>, will be used to demostrate various interesting aspects of WPF in .NET Core 3.0
