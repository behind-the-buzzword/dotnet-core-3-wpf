# dotnet-core-3-wpf
A simple wpf application to demonstrate its functionality in .NET Core 3.0. 


## Master branch

The initial master branch simply is a blank WPF application, with a single `Hello World`button that does nothing.

## Other brances

The other branches that have the naming convention of <stage_number>_<description_of_stage>, will be used to demostrate various interesting aspects of WPF in .NET Core 3.0
